# Up and Running with Angular.js
This is a special version of my [Up and Running with Angular.js](http://www.lynda.com/AngularJS-tutorials/Up-Running-AngularJS/154414-2.html) course on [Lynda.com](http://lynda.com). I added a gulp.js file so that it will run a live reload server.

I've also modified it so that you can add records. Thanks to shenung for adding the ability to upload images as base64.
